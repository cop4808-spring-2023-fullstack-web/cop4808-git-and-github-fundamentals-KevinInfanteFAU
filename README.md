# CALC YA LATER

This is a calculator web application. To make calculations, click on a number for the first operand, then click on an operator, then click on another number for the second operand, then click the equals = sign. Some of the buttons only require one operand, for example the (+/-) button will change the sign of the last-clicked operand. The (%) button will divide the last-clicked operand by 100, and return the output. The "AC" button will clear the input, and reset the operands and operators.

## Description of new operations that were added
### log
Starting from the top left, the "log" button returns the natural log of the last operand divided by the natural log of 10. In other words, it returns the log (base 10) of the last-clicked operand. As an example, log (base 2) of 8 is equal to 3. An equivalent expression is log(base 10) of 8, divided by log(base 10) of 2, is equal to 3. Using the calculator, press (8), then (log), then (/), then (2), then (log), then (=). The answer will be 3.

### mod
Next is the "mod" button, this performs the modulo operation, meaning it divides the first operand by the second operand, then returns the remainder. This button works like the other operators, meaning you will need to press an operand, then the mod button, then another operand, then the equals button. For example, 10 mod 2 returns 0, and 11 mod 2 returns 1.

### √ 
Next is the √, a.k.a. the radical or square root operation. This button only requires one operand, so pressing a number then pressing the (√) will return the square root of that number. For example, pressing 9, then (√) will return 3.

### ^
Next is the ^, or the exponent operator. This button works like the other operators, meaning you will need to press an operand, then the (^) button, then another operand, then the equals button. This will return the first operand to the power of the second operand. For example, pressing 2, then (^), then 3, then (=), will return 8.
